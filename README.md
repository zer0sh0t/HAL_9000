HAL_9000 is a Neural Network library that offers various tools for Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning tasks.

Workflow of this library is inspired by Tensorflow’s Keras.

As of now, HAL_9000 has 6 different operations:

       1. Perceptron
       2. Multilayer Perceptron
       3. Fully connected/Dense Neural Network
       4. Convolutional Neural Network
       5. Deep Q Neural Network
       6. NeuroEvolution
