HAL_9000 is not the best deep learning framework, but it is a deep learning framework.

Workflow of this framework is inspired by Tensorflow’s Keras.

As of now, HAL_9000 offers 6 different NNs:

       1. Perceptron
       2. Multilayer Perceptron
       3. Fully connected/Dense Neural Network
       4. Convolutional Neural Network
       5. Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network
       6. Deep Q Neural Network
